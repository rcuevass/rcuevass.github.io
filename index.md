# Selected  personal side projects

In my spare time I try to explore concepts of interest or develop models with the
intention to stay relevant with developments in the field.

These side projects can include a traditional data exploration exercise, the deployment
of a simple model or investing time in reading papers and prototyping for a deeper 
understanding of a concept of interest.

## Exploration of research-like concepts  

[Playing with language model memorization](https://github.com/rcuevass/lang_model_mem_gpt2)

Due to recent development and interest in LLMs, I got interested in potential implications
of these models with respect to privacy. Specifically I explored the possibility of, given a pre-trained language model, 
extracting data the model was trained on.

This was motivated by research performed by Nicholas Carlini and colleagues. 
The main references for this exploration can be found [here](https://github.com/rcuevass/lang_model_mem_gpt2/tree/main/references).
