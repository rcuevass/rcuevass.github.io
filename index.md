# Selected  personal side projects

In my spare time I try to explore concepts of interest or develop models with the
intention to stay relevant with developments in the field.

These side projects can include a traditional data exploration exercise, the deployment
of a simple model or investing time in reading papers and prototyping for a deeper 
understanding of a concept of interest.

## Basic MCP example  

[Implementation of basic MCP server with Anthropic](https://github.com/rcuevass/MCP_server_example)

Repository to exemplify the implementation of a basic MCP server. Current UI associated with the tool is currently
implemented in python. Further iterations will incorporate Node.js

## Exploration of research-like concepts  

[Playing with language model memorization](https://github.com/rcuevass/lang_model_mem_gpt2)

Due to recent development and interest in LLMs, I got interested in potential implications
of these models with respect to privacy. Specifically I explored the possibility of, given a pre-trained language model, 
extracting data the model was trained on.

This was motivated by research performed by Nicholas Carlini and colleagues. 
The main references for this exploration can be found [here](https://github.com/rcuevass/lang_model_mem_gpt2/tree/main/references).

## General coding

[Mars rover challenge](https://github.com/rcuevass/Mars_rover_challenge)

Repository capturing an implementation of the typical Mars rover challenge. Details of the challenge
can be found in the [README](https://github.com/rcuevass/Mars_rover_challenge/blob/master/README.md) file 
of the repo
